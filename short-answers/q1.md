# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
let name = "mike";
const changeName = (nameToChange) => {
  nameToChange = "tom";
};
changeName(name);
console.log(name);

const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Why was `favoriteLocations` changed, but `name` was not?

# Answer
The variable `name` is a string while the variable `favoriteLocations` is an array. Arrays are passed by reference meaning that the array is targeted by memory location so when a change occurs any reference, it is updated everywhere at once. This is also because arrays are mutable meaning that their content can be permanently changed.
