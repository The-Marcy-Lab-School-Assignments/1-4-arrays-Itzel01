# Question

Look at the following code:

```js
const favoriteLocations = ["New York City", "Jersey City"];
const addBostonToFavorites = (locations) => {
  locations.unshift("Boston");
};
addBostonToFavorites(favoriteLocations);
console.log(favoriteLocations);
```

Is `addBostonToFavorites` a pure function? Why or why not?

# Answer
No it is not, the reason is that the array being targeted with the method `.unshift` is the same array being passed in as the parameter, we did not make a shallow copy. A pure function never mutates the contents of the parameter.
